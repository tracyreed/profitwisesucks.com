David Heistein, of Profitwise Accounting, filed taxes for my LLC as a sole
proprietorship on my personal taxes instead of a partnership on the IRS 1065
form and did not send out K-1s. 

I believe he was extremely negligent or incompetent in this regard.

The IRS EIN letter I was sent when I formed the LLC clearly showed that it was
to be a partnership. But Heistein never even obtained the IRS EIN letter or any
other documentation that I believe he should have when filing taxes for such an
entity would have shown that it was a partnership.

This was my first business, my first LLC, and knowing absolutely nothing about
business taxes I was depending on Heistein of Profitwise Accounting to know how
to handle this. I went years oblivious to this problem not knowing that our
taxes were being filed incorrectly. I did not learn of this problem until the
opposing attorney in a legal matter pointed it out. This GREATLY complicated
the legal matter and cost us dearly.

This has cost me tens of thousands in penalties to the IRS, possibly hundreds
of thousands in legal fees, and thousands more to have the taxes prepared
competently and correctly.
