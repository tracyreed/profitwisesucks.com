[David Heistein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveheistein/){:target="_blank"}, of [Profitwise Accounting](https://www.profitwiseaccounting.com/){:target="_blank"}, prepared and filed taxes for my LLC
as a sole proprietorship on my personal taxes instead of as a partnership on
the IRS 1065 form and did not send out K-1s to the partners.

I believe he was extremely negligent and/or incompetent in this regard and that he has cost me tremendously.

The [IRS EIN letter](/EIN1-9779790.pdf){:target="_blank"} I was sent when I formed the LLC clearly showed that it was
a partnership. The [LLC formation papers](/9779790 Articles Filed.pdf){:target="_blank"} and 
[operating agreement](/9779790_MEMOA.pdf){:target="_blank"} and first [statement of information](/legal zoom SOI.pdf){:target="_blank"}) 
showed 3 partners. But Heistein never even asked for the IRS EIN letter,
formation papers, operating agreement, or any other documentation that I
believe he should have when filing taxes for such an entity which would have
shown that it was a partnership. 

This information was [subpoenaed](/Exhibit 202.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Attachment 3, C(2)) 
"All documentation showing the members of Copilotco, LLC") from him and he
failed to provide it, presumably because either he did not have it (despite it
having been available from the beginning) or he knew it would be problematic
under the circustances.  I believe he should have had it.  Every other tax
preparer I have dealt with since has asked for it without my prompting.

This was my first business entity. It was my first LLC. Knowing absolutely
nothing about business taxes I was depending on Heistein of Profitwise
Accounting to handle this properly. I went years oblivious to this problem not
knowing that our taxes were being filed incorrectly. I did not learn of this
problem until the opposing attorney in a legal matter pointed it out. This
GREATLY complicated the legal matter and cost us dearly.

[Heistein was deposed](/Heistein, David.pdf){:target="_blank"} in the legal
matter. At Heistein Dep. 21:9-24 Mar 3, 2022, we can see that Heistein was asked
about what type of business entity it was.

"So when Tracy had first come to us and it was an LLC, you know, we had some
questions about, you know, did he have this other partner or not. You know, and I think think -- for
some reason I think we decided to move forward with the single-member LLC, as
opposed to a partnership, because that would have alleviated penalties, late
filing penalties, for him.  And I think, based on the information we had at the time, we
decided to move forward with a single member.  It was our understanding that there wasn't
another partner involved with the business." - Heistein Dep. 21:9-24, March 3 2022

"...for some reason..."? How about going with what the government provided
documentation says? "...alleviated penalties..." Does this imply that Heistein
would file improper taxes to save his client from penalties?

Discussion of the documents submitted by Heistein in response to subpoena
begins around page 68. Various tax returns, business income or loss, etc. Note
the lack of EIN letter from IRS, formation documents, operating agreement, etc.
My current tax preparer has all of that. Why didn't Heistein?

The name of the partner, Hamby, appears first at Heistein Dep. 28:15, March 3 2022. "I mean, may be
potential that, you know, that name was maybe brought up, you know, when we
first met with Tracy originally." If there is a question about a potential
partner, wouldn't you look to the formation papers?

And at Heistein Dep. 89:10, Mar 2 2022 we have:

Q And I know you don't remember the name necessarily, Roderick Hamby, but you
do recall a discussion about another potential participant in the LLC; correct?

A Correct.

Q And that was at the inception of the relationship; correct?

A Correct.

Furthermore, in an [email dated July 15, 2020](/Re_ Statements needed.pdf){:target="_blank"}  (this is well before Heistein's deposition testimony of 3/3/2022)
I specifically call out that there are partners and that she was stealing money
from the company. This should have been a big clue to Heistein that the taxes
had been filed improperly all these years. Having been reminded of the partner
situation in this email, I do not understand why it would appear that he
testified to the contrary. I also do not understand why he did not mention the
inconsistancy with how we had been filing taxes all these years when I sent him that email.

Note that the subpoena referenced above called for Heistein to provide "All
documentation of communications, if any, of thefts of funds from Copilotco,
LLC." The above referenced email called out those thefts but Heistein did not
provide it. I believe that he knew, or should have known, about the partners
and the theft because of the email which I sent him.

The only option I was given when I called out this theft/embezzlment (breach of
contract was the legal complaint) in a phone conversation was to account for
her theft as owner draw for tax purposes. So I ended up paying big taxes on
that. It turns out this was not only sub-optimal in terms of taxation but it
also allowed the opposing attorney in our legal matter to claim that since we
accounted for it as owner draw on our taxes and not some sort of theft or
embezzlement and that this was therefore an authorized draw.

This, combined with the fact that Hamby was not shown as a partner on the tax
forms (no 1065 filed or K1's issues), allowed the opposing attorney to spend
hours and many thousands of dollars arguing that Hamby was not a partner and
that he had no standing. This allowed him to drag the matter out so far that it
became uneconomical to continue and upon discussion with council we decided to
dismiss the case.

We were forced to dismiss the case DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PLAINTIFF ADMITTED
TO EVERYTHING SHE WAS ACCUSED OF IN HER DEPOSITION TESTIMONY. Really, her
deposition could not have gone any better for us. Upon defendant's deposition,
we thought this matter would be over quickly with a reasonable settlement.

She acknowledged that Hamby is a partner with an ownership interest in the
company (Trang Dep. 179:4-24, Mar 23, 2022).

She would take money out without coordinating with anyone to the point that
overdraft fees happened and she just relied on the bank teller to tell her when
the account was empty. (Trang Dep. 106:9-14, Feb 4, 2022)

She would write checks to herself on the company account payable to cash
without authorization. (Trang Dep. 108:15-110:10 Feb 4, 2022)

She bought herself an iPad/Macbook/etc (which she never provided to the company) (Trang Dep. 117:9-23, Feb 4, 2022).

She was paying off her personal Target card in the thousands which she used for
personal expenses from the company account. (Trang Dep. 128-129:19-16, Feb 4, 2022)

This activity continued even after she was well aware that she should not be
spending money from the company account and was to no longer be involved in
company operations.

She made it very clear at Trang Dep. 133:3-11, Feb 4, 2022:

"I never treat Copilotco U.S. Bank account as a business account. In my mind,
since the Day One we start the business and open that U.S. Bank account, it is
always our joint account and I treat it just like the other Bank of America
account I own and Tracy owned and we always take the money out in any account
as our income and we file tax for it.  So I don't have that concept of the
business account or use for personal account for personal things." - Trang Dep.
133:3-11, Feb 4, 2022.

Throughout her deposition she explains how she paid personal expenses out of
the company account, did not get authorization, and used the company account
like her own personal piggy bank.

Q And Mr. Reed authorized that to be taken from the business?

A I don't need his authorization to take cash out. I have never had that with him.

- Trang Dep. 90:19-22 Feb 4, 2022

This is just a sampling. There is so much more crazy financial behavior in her 
[deposition](/Deposition of Trang Reed - Transcript - Full - VI[1][2][1].pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

A "bill of particulars" was produced showing all of her personal expenditures
on the company account totalling in the neighborhood of $180,000. As far as I
can tell, she was unable to produce authorization or a business case for any of
it.

So this should be an open and shut case, right?  But I believe that her
attorney knew that he could make such a huge complicated mess out of the tax
matters thanks to Heistein's work that his client could freely tell the truth
about her activities and even then we could never afford to see the matter
through to completion. 

Heistein's name was mentioned SO MANY TIMES throughout the matter. We even had
one particular deposition day where I was called upon to testify in my capacity
as the person most knowledgable in Copilotco tax matters and it was all about
the taxes Heistein had prepared.

Feb 4 2022 deposition of Trang Reed the word “tax” appears 37 times.

Mar 15 2022 deposition of Roderick Hamby the word “tax” appears 127 times.

Mar 16 2022 deposition of Tracy Reed in his personal capacity the word “tax” appears 188 times and “Heistein” appears 37 times.

Oct 31 2023 deposition of Tracy Reed as PMK of Copilotco the word “tax” appears 181 times and “Heistein” appears 168 times and "partnership" is mentioned 36 times.

And then, of course, there's Heistein's deposition which was all about the taxes.

When we finally had to dismiss because it was now far too complicated and
expensive to possibly make it to the end, she turns around and sues us (Reed,
Hamby, AND the attorneys representing us) for malicious prosecution! So it's
not even over yet. The expenses continue to rack up, well into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars. And it is my belief that Heistein is to blame for this
matter not only not being resolved long ago, but that it continues.

I am no attorney, accountant, or tax expert. I did not know anything about
business taxes, K1s, or legal entities. I created the LLC through
LegalZoom. I was just a computer nerd trying to get my first small business and
first serious entrepreneurial effort started. I'm not an MBA (although
defendant Trang is, ironically). I rely on professionals to keep me out of tax
trouble, particularly in these complicated business situations. And the way I
see it, Heistein totally failed me.

This has cost me [tens of thousands in penalties to the IRS](/irs-notices), hundreds of
thousands in legal fees, and thousands more to have the taxes prepared
competently and correctly. The corrected taxes were prepared, filed, and
accepted by the IRS.

DO NOT USE DAVID HEISTEIN OF PROFITWISE ACCOUNTING TO PREPARE YOUR TAXES UNLESS
YOU WANT TO FIND YOURSELF IN AN INTRACTIBLY COMPLICATED AND RUINOUSLY EXPENSIVE
LEGAL QUAGMIRE LIKE I DID.

All of the above is true to the best of my knowledge and I have done the best I
can to support it all with documentation. Note that the truth is an affirmative
defense to accusations of libel so I'm in good stead there. I'm also recently
divorced, broke, had an insolvent business thanks to an embezzling partner, and
have deeply negative net worth with no assets to speak of. So anyone coming
after me for anything would be wasting their time anyway. This is published in
the interest of preventing someone else in the community from befalling the
same ill fate that I have.
