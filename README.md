David Heistein, of Profitwise Accounting, prepared and filed taxes for my LLC
as a sole proprietorship on my personal taxes instead of as a partnership on
the IRS 1065 form and did not send out K-1s.

I believe he was extremely negligent and/or incompetent in this regard.

The IRS EIN letter I was sent when I formed the LLC clearly showed that it was
a partnership. But Heistein never even asked for the IRS EIN letter or any
other documentation that I believe he should have when filing taxes for such an
entity which would have shown that it was a partnership. This information was
subpoenad from him and he was unable to provide it because he did not have it.
I believe he should have had it. Every other tax preparer I have dealt with
since has asked for it without my prompting.

This was my first business entity. It was my first LLC. Knowing absolutely
nothing about business taxes I was depending on Heistein of Profitwise
Accounting to handle this properly. I went years oblivious to this problem not
knowing that our taxes were being filed incorrectly. I did not learn of this
problem until the opposing attorney in a legal matter pointed it out. This
GREATLY complicated the legal matter and cost us dearly.

This has cost me tens of thousands in penalties to the IRS, possibly hundreds
of thousands in legal fees, and thousands more to have the taxes prepared
competently and correctly. The corrected taxes were prepared, filed, and
accepted by the IRS.
