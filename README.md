[David Heistein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveheistein/){:target="_blank"}, of [Profitwise Accounting](https://www.profitwiseaccounting.com/){:target="_blank"}, prepared and filed taxes for my LLC
as a sole proprietorship on my personal taxes instead of as a partnership on
the IRS 1065 form and did not send out K-1s to the partners.

I believe he was extremely negligent and/or incompetent in this regard.

The IRS EIN letter I was sent when I formed the LLC clearly showed that it was
a partnership. The LLC formation papers and operating agreement showed 3
partners. But Heistein never even asked for the IRS EIN letter, formation
papers, operating agreement, or any other documentation that I believe he
should have when filing taxes for such an entity which would have shown that it
was a partnership. This information was [subpoenad](/Exhibit 202.pdf){:target="_blank"} from him and he was unable to
provide it, presumably because he did not have it.  I believe he should have
had it. Every other tax preparer I have dealt with since has asked for it
without my prompting.

This was my first business entity. It was my first LLC. Knowing absolutely
nothing about business taxes I was depending on Heistein of Profitwise
Accounting to handle this properly. I went years oblivious to this problem not
knowing that our taxes were being filed incorrectly. I did not learn of this
problem until the opposing attorney in a legal matter pointed it out. This
GREATLY complicated the legal matter and cost us dearly.

[Heistein was deposed](/Heistein, David.pdf) in the legal matter. At 21:9-24 we can see that Heistein
was asked about what type of business entity it was.

"So when Tracy had first come to us and it was an LLC, you know, we had some
questions about, you know, did he have this other partner or not.  think -- for
some reason I think we decided to move forward with the single-member LLC, as
opposed to a partnership, because that would have alleviated penalties, late
filing penalties, for him.  based on the information we had at the time, we
decided to move forward with a single member.  understanding that there wasn't
another partner involved with the business." - Heistein 21:9-24, March 3 2022

"For some reason"? How about going with what the governmentally issued and
approved documentation says?

Discussion of the documents submitted by Heistein in response to subpoena
begins around page 68. Various tax returns, business income or loss, etc. Note
the lack of EIN letter from IRS, formation documents, operating agreement, etc.
My current tax preparer has all of that. Why didn't Heistein?

The name of the partner, Hamby, appears first at 28:15. "I mean, may be
potential that, you know, that name was maybe brought up, you know, when we
first met with Tracy originally." If there is a question about a potential
partner, wouldn't you look to the formation papers?

And at 89:10 we have:

Q And I know you don't remember the name necessarily, Roderick Hamby, but you
do recall a discussion about another potential participant in the LLC; correct?

A Correct.

Q And that was at the inception of the relationship; correct?

A Correct.

I did not know anything about business taxes, K1, or legal entities. I created
this thing through LegalZoom. I was just a guy trying to get my first small
business and entrepreneurial effort started. I'm not an MBA. I'm not am
attorney. I'm a computer nerd. I need to rely on professionals to keep me out
of tax trouble, particularly in these complicated business situations. Heistein
totally failed me.

This has cost me tens of thousands in penalties to the IRS, possibly hundreds
of thousands in legal fees, and thousands more to have the taxes prepared
competently and correctly. The corrected taxes were prepared, filed, and
accepted by the IRS.
